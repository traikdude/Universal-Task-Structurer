# 🧙🏾‍♂️ Universal Task Structurer - Troubleshooting Database Ledger 🗃️✨

This ledger catalogs the problems encountered, diagnostic paths taken, and resolutions applied during the local React restoration and Gemini API integration session. 🔌⚙️

📁 File Name / Reference: [Google Apps Script Web App Integration](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/gas/Code.js)
File Type: Log / Code
Record ID: TDB-001
Date Processed: 2026-06-07
Category / Tags: Software, Authentication, OAuth

🛑 Issue Identified
The migrated Google Apps Script Web App failed to render for the user, resulting in a persistent blank screen. 🛑👀
- Multi-login Google account session conflicts blocked the server-side Apps Script backend. 🔒🚫
- Sandbox iframe restrictions threw CORS errors and blocked browser local storage access. 💻❌
- Client-side Google OAuth buttons failed to initialize within the double-sandboxed container. 🔑🚫

✅ Resolution Applied
1. Attempted single-file compilation, Base64 bundle encoding, and clipboard legacy selections. ⚙️🛠️
2. Ultimately abandoned the Apps Script wrapper architecture due to unresolvable multi-account authentication conflicts. 🔄🚪
3. Reverted the entire repository back to the pre-migration standalone client-side React app (Commit `f909e14`). 🏛️✨
Resolution Status: ✅ Fully Resolved (by codebase reversion)

📁 File Name / Reference: [Vite Local Dev Server Port 3000 Conflict](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/package.json)
File Type: Log / Network
Record ID: TDB-002
Date Processed: 2026-06-07
Category / Tags: Network, Software, DevOps

🛑 Issue Identified
Navigating to the newly launched Vite dev server on `http://localhost:3000/` returned a blank page with a `Cannot GET /` error. 🛑👀
- Netstat diagnostics revealed a port bind conflict on port 3000. 🔌🔍
- A residual, orphaned node process (`PID 7252`) from a previous session was occupying port 3000. ⚙️🚫
- The orphaned process was returning Express 404 responses instead of routing to the Vite dev server (`PID 40672`). ❌🌐

✅ Resolution Applied
1. Executed a PowerShell command `Stop-Process -Id 7252 -Force` to terminate the conflicting orphaned process. 🔌🧹
2. Canceled the conflicting Vite dev server background task (`task-3085`). ⚙️❌
3. Restarted `npm run dev` cleanly as a new background task (`task-3130`). ⚡🔄
4. Verified that Vite successfully claimed exclusive ownership of port 3000 and served the page. 🏆🌐
Resolution Status: ✅ Fully Resolved

📁 File Name / Reference: [Local Gemini API Key 403 Errors](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/.env.local)
File Type: Log / Environment
Record ID: TDB-003
Date Processed: 2026-06-07
Category / Tags: Software, Authentication, Gemini API

🛑 Issue Identified
Executing task extraction requests on the local site resulted in `403 PERMISSION_DENIED` errors from the Gemini API. 🛑👀
- The initial `.env.local` API key was a placeholder. 🔑🚫
- Testing with system-configured keys (Stitch and Jules) failed because the Generative Language API was disabled in their Google Cloud projects. ❌🛰️

✅ Resolution Applied
1. Located the user's active Gemini API key (`AIzaSyD_vJWvMEYj2EqCTew5NBP9vkTmoJNNDyQ`) inside a duplicate workspace folder (`C:\Users\traik\.antigravity\github repo\universal-task-structurer\universal-task-structurer\.env.local`). 🔑🔍
2. Synced the active key value into the active workspace's [.env.local](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/.env.local) file. ⚡🔄
3. Confirmed that the dev server restarted and loaded the new key automatically. 🔌⚙️
4. Ran a task extraction query in Chrome DevTools to confirm successful streaming and UI card rendering. 🎉🥳
Resolution Status: ✅ Fully Resolved
