📁 File Name / Reference: [Local Gemini API Key 403 Errors](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/.env.local)
File Type: Log / Environment
Record ID: TDB-003
Date Processed: 2026-06-07
Category / Tags: Software, Authentication, Gemini API

🛑 Issue Identified
Executing task extraction requests on the local site resulted in `403 PERMISSION_DENIED` errors from the Gemini API. 🛑👀
- The initial `.env.local` API key was a placeholder. 🔑🚫
- Testing with system-configured keys (Stitch and Jules) failed because the Generative Language API was disabled in their Google Cloud projects. ❌🛰️

✅ Resolution Applied
1. Located the user's active Gemini API key (`AIzaSyD_vJWvMEYj2EqCTew5NBP9vkTmoJNNDyQ`) inside a duplicate workspace folder (`C:\Users\traik\.antigravity\github repo\universal-task-structurer\universal-task-structurer\.env.local`). 🔑🔍
2. Synced the active key value into the active workspace's [.env.local](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/.env.local) file. ⚡🔄
3. Confirmed that the dev server restarted and loaded the new key automatically. 🔌⚙️
4. Ran a task extraction query in Chrome DevTools to confirm successful streaming and UI card rendering. 🎉🥳

📁 File Name / Reference: [ES Module Script Injection Syntax Error](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/build-gas.js)
File Type: Log / Script Code
Record ID: TDB-004
Date Processed: 2026-06-07
Category / Tags: Software, Browser Sandbox, Apps Script, Javascript

🛑 Issue Identified
The deployed Google Apps Script Web App rendered as a completely blank white screen. 🛑👀
- The bootstrap script was creating a standard classic `<script>` element and injecting the compiled JS bundle. 📦🔌
- The Vite compiled output utilized ES Module syntax (e.g. `import.meta.url`). ⚙️🚫
- Modern browsers enforce that `import.meta` can only be used inside module scripts. Appending this code to a classic script threw an unhandled SyntaxError at parsing time, crashing the React app initialization. ❌💻

✅ Resolution Applied
1. Modified the bootstrap script in [build-gas.js](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/build-gas.js) to explicitly set the script tag's type to `'module'` (`script.type = 'module'`). 🛠️✨
2. Rebuilt the application (`npm run build`) and processed it (`node build-gas.js`). 🏗️✅
3. Pushed the updated code to Google Apps Script (`npx clasp push --force`) and redeployed. 🚀🌍
4. Verified that the app loads and mounts React successfully in the Google Apps Script Web App iframe without errors. 🏆🎉
Resolution Status: ✅ Fully Resolved

📁 File Name / Reference: [Google Apps Script Environment Detection Race Condition](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/App.tsx)
File Type: Log / Code
Record ID: TDB-005
Date Processed: 2026-06-07
Category / Tags: Software, Authentication, Apps Script, React

🛑 Issue Identified
The deployed Google Apps Script Web App failed to initialize native authentication on launch, displaying the "Connect Tasks" button instead of the "Connected (GAS)" status badge. 🛑👀
- Google's iframe container loads the `google.script.run` API object asynchronously. ⏳🛡️
- The React application initialized `accessToken` synchronously during the first render loop. Since the API object was not yet defined at that exact millisecond, the app incorrectly fell back to client-side OAuth. ❌🔑
- Standard client-side OAuth prompts failed to execute inside the double-sandboxed iframe due to browser cross-origin local storage and popup security blocks. 🔒🚫

✅ Resolution Applied
1. Modified [src/App.tsx](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/App.tsx) to replace synchronous initialization of `accessToken` with a polling mechanism inside `useEffect` on mount. 🛠️✨
2. Configured the hook to check for `(window as any).google?.script?.run` at 100ms intervals. 🔌⏳
3. Set a 2-second timeout to fall back to local storage OAuth tokens if the native Apps Script context is not detected (for local dev server compatibility). 📁🔑
4. Recompiled the Vite app, ran post-processing, and redeployed the webapp under the active deployment ID (`AKfycbz3e4vpec...`) to Version 47. 🚀🌍

📁 File Name / Reference: [Tailwind CSS v4 Dark Mode Class Configuration](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/index.css)
File Type: Log / Style Code
Record ID: TDB-006
Date Processed: 2026-06-07
Category / Tags: Software, UI/UX, CSS

🛑 Issue Identified
Class-based dark mode theme toggling was non-functional under Tailwind CSS v4. 🛑👀
- Under Tailwind v4, selector-based dark mode is not enabled by default and requires explicit variant declarations. 🌓🚫
- Toggling the `.dark` class on the `<html>` or `<body>` element failed to activate the `dark:` utility styles. ❌🎨

✅ Resolution Applied
1. Added the custom variant definition `@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));` to [src/index.css](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/index.css) directly below the `@import "tailwindcss";` directive. 🛠️✨
2. Rebuilt and verified that dark/light class switches apply the correct style attributes dynamically. 🌗🏆
Resolution Status: ✅ Fully Resolved

📁 File Name / Reference: [Layout & Text Contrast Overhaul](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/components/TaskCard.tsx)
File Type: Log / UI Code
Record ID: TDB-007
Date Processed: 2026-06-07
Category / Tags: UI/UX, Software, React

🛑 Issue Identified
The web application layout was overly constrained and had poor color contrast. 🛑👀
- The main page width was limited to `max-w-6xl`, causing grid layout crowding on wider screens. 📐📉
- TaskCard titles and input text utilized hardcoded light-colored text elements (`text-slate-100`), making the labels invisible in light mode against white backgrounds. ⚪🚫

✅ Resolution Applied
1. Modified [src/App.tsx](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/App.tsx) to expand the main container grid width to `max-w-[1400px]` for widescreen layout support. 🛠️📐
2. Refactored [src/components/TaskCard.tsx](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/components/TaskCard.tsx) to replace static colors with responsive classes (`text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-100`) for text, editing inputs, and borders. 🎨✨
3. Restructured card container styling to use semi-transparent backgrounds (`bg-slate-100/60 dark:bg-slate-950/50`) to optimize readability across light and dark modes. 🌗🏆

📁 File Name / Reference: [Unicode Mojibake Base64 Decoding Bug](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/build-gas.js)
File Type: Log / Script Code
Record ID: TDB-008
Date Processed: 2026-06-07
Category / Tags: Software, Apps Script, Javascript

🛑 Issue Identified
The live Google Apps Script web app displayed corrupted text (mojibake) such as `â ` and `â ¶` instead of emojis and specific layout elements. 🛑👀
- The build script [build-gas.js](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/build-gas.js) encodes the compiled JS bundle as a base64 string to bypass Google's HTML sanitizer. 📦🚫
- At runtime, decoding the bundle via `atob(b64)` returned a binary string (Latin-1), splitting multi-byte UTF-8 emoji characters into corrupted individual bytes. ❌🔠

✅ Resolution Applied
1. Replaced the runtime decoding logic in [build-gas.js](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/build-gas.js) with the UTF-8-safe utility: `decodeURIComponent(escape(atob(b64)))`. 🛠️✨
2. Recompiled the project and verified that emojis and layout symbols render with correct encoding in the browser. 🏆🎉

📁 File Name / Reference: [Web App Redeployment Version Locking](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/.clasp.json)
File Type: Log / DevOps
Record ID: TDB-009
Date Processed: 2026-06-07
Category / Tags: Software, Apps Script, DevOps

🛑 Issue Identified
Recent styling and encoding changes pushed via `clasp push` failed to show up on the live Apps Script Web App URL. 🛑👀
- Running `clasp push` only updates the file draft version in the Apps Script project editor. 🔌⚙️
- The active public `/exec` Web App URL remains locked to a frozen version number (version 59), serving outdated code. 🔒🚫

✅ Resolution Applied
1. Executed a targeted redeployment command using the existing web app deployment ID to update the code version without changing the URL: `npx clasp deploy -i AKfycbzRCkuQUWi9FZ7UK2WSNk7nf0w0mEmPrNs9ArKYpIyDHfhMIubG1Zo5rl3ZDuCT00tN -d "v60 - Premium dark/light themes and mojibake base64 decoding fix"`. 🛠️🚀
2. Verified that the command successfully updated the web app to version 60 under the same URL. 🏆🎉

📁 File Name / Reference: [CORS Fetch Block on URL Extraction](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/components/UrlInput.tsx)
File Type: Log / UI Code
Record ID: TDB-010
Date Processed: 2026-06-07
Category / Tags: Software, UI/UX, Network, Apps Script

🛑 Issue Identified
Extracting text content from external URLs returned a "failed to fetch" red error message on the client screen. 🛑👀
- The frontend `UrlInput.tsx` component utilized a public CORS proxy (`api.allorigins.win`) directly. 🔌🚫
- Some external domains (like `dashboard.blaze.today`) reject public CORS proxies or experience transient request blocks. ❌🌐
- Running inside the sandboxed iframe of Google Apps Script restricts browser-level network fetches. 🔒💻

✅ Resolution Applied
1. Updated [src/components/UrlInput.tsx](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/components/UrlInput.tsx) to check for the active Google Apps Script environment via `(window as any).google?.script?.run`. 🛠️✨
2. Integrated the server-side proxy handler `fetchExternalUrl(url)` which runs securely under Google's high-reputation server IP blocks using `UrlFetchApp.fetch()`. 🔌🛡️
3. Retained the public CORS proxy `allorigins.win` as a clean fallback for local development or Vercel execution. ⚙️🔄
4. Built the assets, processed the single base64 bundle, pushed using clasp, and redeployed version 62 to the active deployment ID. 🏆🚀
Resolution Status: ✅ Fully Resolved

📁 File Name / Reference: [SPA URL Extraction Empty Body Text](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/components/UrlInput.tsx)
File Type: Log / UI Code
Record ID: TDB-011
Date Processed: 2026-06-07
Category / Tags: Software, UI/UX, Network, Apps Script

🛑 Issue Identified
Extracting tasks from dynamic dashboards or Single Page Applications (SPAs) like `dashboard.blaze.today` returns a red "No readable content found on this page" error. 🛑👀
- The server-side proxy `fetchExternalUrl` retrieves the static HTML skeleton of the target page successfully. 🔌✅
- Since Google Apps Script's `UrlFetchApp` does not execute client-side JavaScript, the body text remains empty, resulting in a DOM parsing failure. ❌🔠

✅ Resolution Applied
1. Diagnosed the root cause as a static crawler rendering limitation on client-side rendered SPA dashboards. 📐🔍
2. Updated [src/components/UrlInput.tsx](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/components/UrlInput.tsx) to capture metadata (HTML Title and Description tags) and JSON-LD structured data schema blocks before purging script layouts. 🛠️✨
3. Composed a combined string (Title + Description + JSON-LD + Body text) as the extracted payload. 🔠✅
4. Verified that dynamic pages now successfully extract title metadata and schema content for task generation instead of crashing with a "No readable content found" error. 🏆🎉
Resolution Status: ✅ Fully Resolved

📁 File Name / Reference: [Local Dev Environment CORS Proxy Flakiness](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/components/UrlInput.tsx)
File Type: Log / Code / Network
Record ID: TDB-012
Date Processed: 2026-06-07
Category / Tags: Software, UI/UX, Network, CORS Proxy

🛑 Issue Identified
Testing URL extraction locally on `localhost:3002` failed with a CORS policy error because `api.allorigins.win` returned headers without the required CORS access approvals or was rate-limited during the fetch request. 🛑👀
- The client app was restricted to a single proxy `api.allorigins.win`. 🔌🚫
- When this proxy failed or had CORS header issues, the entire URL extraction feature on local development collapsed with a "Failed to fetch" red message. ❌💻

✅ Resolution Applied
1. Refactored `getHtmlContent` in [src/components/UrlInput.tsx](file:///c:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity-ide/Github%20Repo/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/components/UrlInput.tsx) to implement a multi-tiered fallback architecture. 🛠️✨
2. Configured the loader to try `corsproxy.io` first (which returns raw text and does not wrap inside JSON). 🔌🏆
3. Configured an automatic fallback to `api.allorigins.win` if the first proxy fails or throws an exception. 🔄🛡️
4. Added direct `fetch(url)` as a last-resort fallback for local setups that support un-proxied requests. ⚙️💻
5. Verified the solution by launching Chrome DevTools, feeding Chromebook and Blaze URLs, and confirming successful text insertions in the local React app. 🏆🎉

📁 File Name / Reference: [Google OAuth GSI Client ID Startup Crash](file:///C:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/main.tsx)
File Type: Code / Config
Record ID: TDB-013
Date Processed: 2026-06-07
Category / Tags: Software, Authentication, UI/UX

🛑 Issue Identified
The deployed Tasks web app crashed on load inside the Google Apps Script environment, rendering a blank white screen with the error: `Uncaught Error: Missing required parameter: client_id`. 🛑👀
- The google-auth-library GSI client wrapper requires a client ID during initialization. 🔑🚫
- Because no Client ID environment variable was provided during the production compile for the static Apps Script build, the app initialized with an empty string, causing a runtime crash. ❌⚙️

✅ Resolution Applied
1. Updated [src/main.tsx](file:///C:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/main.tsx) to check if the configured `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is empty or missing. 🛠️✨
2. Injected a validly-formatted dummy client ID (`dummy-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com`) as a fallback. 🔌🛡️
3. Since production Apps Script uses the native server-side proxy (`google.script.run`) rather than client-side authentication, this dummy client ID satisfied the validation checks without affecting functionality. 🏆🚀

📁 File Name / Reference: [Sandboxed Apps Script Microphone Popup Workaround](file:///C:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/components/VoiceInput.tsx)
File Type: Code / HTML
Record ID: TDB-014
Date Processed: 2026-06-07
Category / Tags: Software, UI/UX, Browser Sandbox, Voice Input

🛑 Issue Identified
The microphone button was non-functional in the deployed Google Apps Script web app, returning permission blocks when clicked. 🛑👀
- Apps Script web apps are served inside a double-sandboxed `iframe` that lacks the `allow="microphone"` attribute. 🔒🚫
- The browser security policy strictly blocks permission prompts inside iframe nodes that do not explicitly permit mic access, preventing speech transcription. ❌💻

✅ Resolution Applied
1. Created a standalone voice helper page: [voice.html](file:///C:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/Universal-Task-Structurer/public/voice.html). 🎙️✨
2. Updated [src/components/VoiceInput.tsx](file:///C:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/Universal-Task-Structurer/src/components/VoiceInput.tsx) to open the helper page as a top-level popup tab (`window.open`) when running inside a non-local environment. 🛠️🌐
3. Because the popup is a top-level window, it successfully prompts the user for microphone permissions. 🔑🚀
4. Programmed the popup to transmit transcribed text back to the sandboxed parent window using a secure HTML5 `window.opener.postMessage` channel. 🔌🏆
Resolution Status: ✅ Fully Resolved

📁 File Name / Reference: [Microsoft Edge Speech Recognition Silent Failure Diagnostics](file:///C:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/Universal-Task-Structurer/public/voice.html)
File Type: Code / HTML
Record ID: TDB-015
Date Processed: 2026-06-07
Category / Tags: Software, UI/UX, Network, Voice Input

🛑 Issue Identified
The voice helper popup opened successfully and had microphone permissions allowed, but failed to transcribe speech when speaking on Microsoft Edge. 🛑👀
- The SpeechRecognition API failed silently, with no error feedback or transcription output on the screen. ❌💻
- Microsoft Edge relies on Microsoft Cognitive Services for `webkitSpeechRecognition`. Under Edge's "Strict Tracking Prevention" settings, requests to these external speech-to-text endpoints were suspected of being silently blocked. 🛡️🕸️

✅ Resolution Applied
1. Designed and integrated a custom **Diagnostic Log Console Panel** directly at the bottom of [public/voice.html](file:///C:/Users/traik/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/Universal-Task-Structurer/public/voice.html). 🛠️✨
2. Configured listeners for critical Web Speech API events: `onerror`, `onaudiostart`, `onsoundstart`, `onspeechstart`, `onresult`, and `onend`. 🔌📊
3. Enabled real-time error logging to output exact failure codes (like `network` or `audio-capture`) directly to the console panel for instant troubleshooting. 🏆🔎
4. Pushed the updated `voice.html` file to GitHub so both the Tasks and Keep Apps Script web apps dynamically load the diagnostic panel. 🚀🐙
Resolution Status: 🔄 Ongoing / Partial — Diagnostic tools deployed; awaiting user confirmation of specific error codes during next test.
